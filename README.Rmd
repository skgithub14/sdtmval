The goal of {sdtmval} is to provide a set of tools to assist statistical programmers in validating Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) data sets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {sdtmval} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("skgithub14/sdtmval")
```

## A typical work flow example

In this example work flow, we will load in a raw EDC table and transform it into a SDTM domain table. We will use the fake domain is 'XX'. 

```{r ex-set-up}
# set-up
library(sdtmval)
library(dplyr)

domain <- "XX"
work_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "sdtmval")
```

The majority of the data needed is in the EDC form/table xx.csv. There is also visit date data in the raw EDC form/table vd.csv and study start and end dates by subject in the production SDTM table dm.sas7dbat. We will start by importing all of the data we need using the two functions `read_edc_tbls()` and `read_sdtm_tbls()`. The main difference between these two functions is that the first reads in .csv files and the second reads in .sas7dbat files.

```{r ex-import}
# read in EDC tables from the forms XX and VD
edc_tbls <- c("xx", "vd")
edc_dat <- read_edc_tbls(edc_tbls, dir = work_dir)

# read in SDTM domain DM
sdtm_tbls <- c("dm")
sdtm_dat <- read_sdtm_tbls(sdtm_tbls, dir = work_dir)

knitr::kable(edc_dat$xx)
```

The next thing we will do is get the relevant information from the SDTM specification for the study. The next set of functions assumes there is a .xlsx file which contains the sheets: 'Datasets', 'XX', and 'Codelists'. 'Datasets' contains the key variables by domain, 'XX' gives the variable information for the XX domain, and 'Codelists' provides a table of coded/decoded values by variable.

```{r ex-spec}
spec_fname <- "spec.xlsx"
spec <- get_data_spec(domain = domain, dir = work_dir, filename = spec_fname)
key_vars <- get_key_vars(domain = domain, dir = work_dir, filename = spec_fname)
codelists <- get_codelist(domain = domain, dir = work_dir, filename = spec_fname)
```

Now we will begin creating the SDTM XX domain using the EDC XX form as the basis. First, it needs some pre-processing because there is extra white space in some of the variable which needs trimming. We also want to turn all NA equivalent values to `NA` for the entire data set for consistency (in a step near the end these will all be converted back to `""`).

```{r trim-and-NA}
sdtm_xx1 <- trim_and_make_blanks_NA(edc_dat$xx)
knitr::kable(sdtm_xx1)
```

In order to calculate the timing variables XXBLFL, EPOCH, and XXDY, we need to the visit dates from the EDC VD table and the study start/end dates by subject from the SDTM DM table.

```{r merge-vd}
sdtm_xx2 <- sdtm_xx1 %>%
  
  # get the VISITDTC column from the EDC VD form
  left_join(edc_dat$vd, by = c("USUBJID", "VISIT")) %>%
  rename(XXDTC = VISITDTC) %>%
  
  # get the 
  left_join(sdtm_dat$dm, by = "USUBJID")
  
knitr::kable(sdtm_xx2)
```

Now, we can proceed with calculating those timing variables:

```{r timing-vars}
sdtm_xx3 <- sdtm_xx2 %>%
  
  # XXBLFL
  create_BLFL(sort_date = "XXDTC",
              domain = domain,
              grouping_vars = c("USUBJID", "XXTESTCD")) %>%
  
  # EPOCH
  create_EPOCH(date_col = "XXDTC") %>%
  
  # XXDY
  calc_DY(DY_col = "XXDY",
          DTC_col = "XXDTC")
  
knitr::kable(sdtm_xx3)
```
