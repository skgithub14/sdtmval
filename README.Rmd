The goal of {sdtmval} is to provide a set of tools to assist statistical programmers in validating Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) data sets. The tools include utilities for:

-   Importing EDC and SDTM data

-   Reading in and applying study specification data

-   Data formatting

-   Commonly used SDTM methods: BLFL, DY, EPOCH, and SEQ

The above features are demonstrated in the example workflow shown below. The additional features below each have their own vignette/article:

-   Imputing and formatting full and partial dates: see the ['Dates' vignette](Dates.html)

-   Comparing QC versus production SDTM domain tables: see the COMING SOON

The first four points above are demonstrated in the README example below. See the vignette/article 'Dates' for an example

## Installation

You can install the development version of {sdtmval} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("skgithub14/sdtmval")
```

## A typical work flow example

In this example work flow, we will load in a raw EDC table and transform it into a SDTM domain table. We will use the fake domain is 'XX'.

```{r ex-set-up, message=FALSE}
# set-up
library(sdtmval)
library(dplyr)

domain <- "XX"

# set working directory (this can be anything)
work_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "sdtmval")
```

The majority of the data needed is in the EDC form/table xx.csv. There is also visit date data in the raw EDC form/table vd.csv and study start and end dates by subject in the production SDTM table dm.sas7dbat. We will start by importing all of the data we need using the two functions `read_edc_tbls()` and `read_sdtm_tbls()`. The main difference between these two functions is that the first reads in .csv files and the second reads in .sas7dbat files.

```{r ex-import}
# read in EDC tables from the forms XX and VD
edc_tbls <- c("xx", "vd")
edc_dat <- read_edc_tbls(edc_tbls, dir = work_dir)

# read in SDTM domain DM
sdtm_tbls <- c("dm")
sdtm_dat <- read_sdtm_tbls(sdtm_tbls, dir = work_dir)
```

The raw data looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
edc_dat$xx %>%
  mutate(across(.cols = everything(),
                ~ stringr::str_replace_all(., " ", "&nbsp;"))) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

The next thing we will do is get the relevant information from the SDTM specification for the study. The next set of functions assumes there is a .xlsx file which contains the sheets: 'Datasets', 'XX', and 'Codelists'. 'Datasets' contains the key variables by domain, 'XX' gives the variable information for the XX domain, and 'Codelists' provides a table of coded/decoded values by variable. `get_data_spec()` imports the domain tab from the specification file as a data frame, `get_key_vars()` retrieves the key variables for a domain as a character vector, and `get_codelist` extracts a data frame of coded/decoded values from the spec for any variables in the relevant domain.

```{r ex-spec}
spec_fname <- "spec.xlsx"
spec <- get_data_spec(domain = domain, dir = work_dir, filename = spec_fname)
key_vars <- get_key_vars(domain = domain, dir = work_dir, filename = spec_fname)
codelists <- get_codelist(domain = domain, dir = work_dir, filename = spec_fname)

knitr::kable(spec)
knitr::kable(codelists)
key_vars
```

Now we will begin creating the SDTM XX domain using the EDC XX form as the basis.

First, it needs some pre-processing because there is extra white space in some of the variables. We also want to turn all NA equivalent values like `""` and `" "` to `NA` for the entire data set so we have consistent handling of missing values during data processing. The function `trim_and_make_blanks_NA()` does both of these tasks.

```{r trim-and-NA}
sdtm_xx1 <- trim_and_make_blanks_NA(edc_dat$xx)
knitr::kable(sdtm_xx1)
```

Next, using the codelists we retrieved from the spec earlier, we can create the `XXTEST` variable.

```{r xxtest}
# prepare the code list so it can be used by dplyr::recode() 
xxtestcd_codelist <- codelists %>%
  filter(ID == "XXTESTCD") %>%
  select(Term, `Decoded Value`) %>%
  tibble::deframe()

# create XXTEST variable
sdtm_xx2 <- mutate(sdtm_xx1, XXTEST = recode(XXTESTCD, !!!xxtestcd_codelist))

knitr::kable(sdtm_xx2)
```

In order to calculate the timing variables XXBLFL, EPOCH, and XXDY, we need the visit dates from the EDC VD table and the study start/end dates by subject from the SDTM DM table.

```{r merge-vd}
sdtm_xx3 <- sdtm_xx2 %>%
  
  # get the VISITDTC column from the EDC VD form
  left_join(edc_dat$vd, by = c("USUBJID", "VISIT")) %>%
  rename(XXDTC = VISITDTC) %>%
  
  # get the study start/end dates by subject (RFSTDTC, RFXSTDTC, RFXENDTC)
  left_join(sdtm_dat$dm, by = "USUBJID")
```

Now, we can proceed with calculating those timing variables using the `create_BLFL()`, `create_EPOCH()`, and `calc_DY()` functions.

```{r timing-vars}
sdtm_xx4 <- sdtm_xx3 %>%
  
  # XXBLFL
  create_BLFL(sort_date = "XXDTC",
              domain = domain,
              grouping_vars = c("USUBJID", "XXTESTCD")) %>%
  
  # EPOCH
  create_EPOCH(date_col = "XXDTC") %>%
  
  # XXDY
  calc_DY(DY_col = "XXDY",
          DTC_col = "XXDTC")
  
knitr::kable(sdtm_xx4)
```

Next, we will assign the sequence number using `assign_SEQ()`. This function also sorts the data set for you by whatever you make the `key_vars` argument.

```{r}
sdtm_xx5 <- assign_SEQ(sdtm_xx4, 
                       key_vars = c("USUBJID", "XXTESTCD", "VISIT"),
                       seq_prefix = domain)
knitr::kable(sdtm_xx5)
```

Now that the bulk of the data cleaning is complete, we will convert all date columns to character columns and all `NA` values to `""` so that our validation table matches the production table.

```{r}
sdtm_xx6 <- format_chars_and_dates(sdtm_xx5)
knitr::kable(sdtm_xx6)
```

As a final step, we re-order the columns according to the domain spec and drop the extra columns using this line of code: `select(any_of(spec$Variable))`. Then we will assign the meta data from the spec to each column using `assign_meta_data()`. The meta data includes the labels for each column and their maximum allowed character lengths.

```{r}
sdtm_xx7 <- sdtm_xx6 %>%
  select(any_of(spec$Variable)) %>%
  assign_meta_data(spec = spec)

# show the final SDTM domain
knitr::kable(sdtm_xx7)

# check the meta data was assigned
labels <- colnames(sdtm_xx7) %>%
  purrr::map(~ attr(sdtm_xx7[[.]], "label")) %>%
  unlist()
lengths <- colnames(sdtm_xx7) %>%
  purrr::map(~ attr(sdtm_xx7[[.]], "width")) %>%
  unlist()
data.frame(
  column = colnames(sdtm_xx7),
  labels = labels,
  lengths = lengths
)
```

Finally, we will write the SDTM XX domain validation table as a SAS transport file using `write_tbl_to_xpt()` (which is just a convenience wrapper for `haven::write_xpt()`).

```{r}
write_tbl_to_xpt(sdtm_xx7, filename = domain, dir = work_dir)
```

For each previous steps, we viewed the interim results to demonstrate the features of {sdtmval} however, {sdtmval} is designed to be used with pipe operators so that you can have one long, read-able pipe. To demonstrate, we will reproduce the same results from above in one code chunk.

```{r}
sdtm_xx <- edc_dat$xx %>%
  
  # pre-processing
  trim_and_make_blanks_NA() %>%
  
  # XXTEST
  dplyr::mutate(XXTEST = dplyr::recode(XXTESTCD, !!!xxtestcd_codelist)) %>%

  # get the VISITDTC column from the EDC VD form
  dplyr::left_join(edc_dat$vd, by = c("USUBJID", "VISIT")) %>%
  dplyr::rename(XXDTC = VISITDTC) %>%

  # get the study start/end dates by subject
  dplyr::left_join(sdtm_dat$dm, by = "USUBJID") %>%

  # XXBLFL
  create_BLFL(sort_date = "XXDTC",
              domain = domain,
              grouping_vars = c("USUBJID", "XXTESTCD")) %>%

  # EPOCH
  create_EPOCH(date_col = "XXDTC") %>%

  # XXDY
  calc_DY(DY_col = "XXDY",
          DTC_col = "XXDTC") %>%

  # XXSEQ
  assign_SEQ(key_vars = c("USUBJID", "XXTESTCD", "VISIT"),
             seq_prefix = domain) %>%

  # final formatting
  format_chars_and_dates() %>%
  dplyr::select(dplyr::any_of(spec$Variable)) %>%
  assign_meta_data(spec = spec)

# check if the two data frames are identical
identical(sdtm_xx, sdtm_xx7)
```
