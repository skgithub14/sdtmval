 - Automated GitHub actions checks for R CMD build, with README badge
 
 - Unit testing using {testthat}
 
 - Automated GitHub actions for code testing using CodeCov and {covr}
 
 - README built in .Rmd
 

## Initial Set-up

```{r}
available::available("sdtmval")

### 2. Create a new directory:

```{r}
# dir.create("sdtmval")

### 3. Set-up the directory as an R package:

```{r}
create_package("sdtmval")
```


### 4. Populate the DESCRIPTION file
