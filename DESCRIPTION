Description: {sdtmval} provides a set of tools to assist statistical programmers 
    in validating Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) data sets. Statistical 
    programmers are required to validate that a SDTM data set domain has been 
    programmed correctly, per the SDTM Implementation Guide (SDTMIG), study 
    specification, and study protocol using a process called double programming. 
    Double programming involves two different programmers idependently 
    converting the raw electronic data cut (EDC) data in a SDTM domain data 
    table and comparing the results to ensure accurate standardization of the 
    data. One of these attempts is termed "production" and the other 
    "validation". Generally, production runs are the official programs for 
    submittals and these are written in SAS. Validation runs can be programmed 
    in another language, in this case R.
